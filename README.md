# Graphene

Reference implementation of the simulations and post-processing pipeline used in  
**“Ab-initio defect study of disordered two-dimensional graphene structures”**  
(EPFL TPIV - Physics Project II, Spring 2025).

## Main figures

The main figures are cached in the notebooks. The orientational and translational correlation functions are stored in `notebooks/main_analysis.ipynb`, and the structures are for instance in  `notebooks/structure_analysis.ipynb`. Most of the analysis is available in these folders.

- One of the main LAMMPS melting protocols used in the study are given as example in `LAMMPS/melting.in`
